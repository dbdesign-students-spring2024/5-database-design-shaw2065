## What makes this data set not compliant with 4NF
- **The data set does not satisfy the requirements of second normal form.** There are non-key fields that are facts about only a part of the entity. The composite primary key composed of both `assignment_id` and `student_id`. However, non-key fields such as `assignment_topic` and `relevant_reading` are only dependent on one subset of the composite primary key, `assignment_id`, instead of being fully dependent on the entire primary key.

- **The data set does not satisfy the requirements of third normal form.** There are non-key fields that are about another non-key field. For example, the non-key field, `professor_email`, is a fact about another non-key field, `professor`.

## What changes have been made to make the data 4NF-compliant
1. **In Compliance with with second and third normal form, ensure every non-key field is a fact about the entire primary key.** For instance, if `section_id` and `due_date` are included in the 7th table of assignments, the other non-key fields, namely `assignment_topic` and `relevant_reading`, will be partially dependent on the subset, `assignment_id`, of the composite primary key, which does not comply with second normal form. Meanwhile, if both `professor_name` and `professor_email` are included in the 3rd table of sections, it would violate third normal form, as they are fact about each other instead of the key field, `section_id`.

2. **In Compliance with fourth normal form, keep the number of independent multi-valued facts about an entity under two.** While the 6th table of student courses may appear to violate fourth normal form, `course_id` and `section_id` are not independent of each other. Their interdependence allows them to be presented in a single record. The same applies to `section_id` and `due_date` in the 8th table of assignment due dates. Conversely, since one specific assignment can have different due dates even if given by the same professor, including both `due_date` and `professor` will result in having two independent multi-valued facts in the same record, as `due_date` and `professor` are not guranteed to be dependent on each other.
