## What makes this data set not compliant with 4NF
- **The data set does not satisfy the requirements of second normal form.** There are non-key fields that are facts about only a part of the entity. The composite primary key is composed of both `assignment_id` and `student_id`. However, non-key fields such as `assignment_topic` and `relevant_reading` are only dependent on one subset of the composite primary key, `assignment_id`, instead of being fully dependent on the entire primary key.

- **The data set does not satisfy the requirements of third normal form.** There are non-key fields that are about another non-key field. For example, the non-key field, `professor_email`, is a fact about another non-key field, `professor`.

## What changes have been made to make the data 4NF-compliant
1. **In Compliance with with second and third normal form, ensure every non-key field is a fact about the entire primary key.** For instance, if `assignment_topic` is included in the 7th table of assignment info, it will then be partially dependent on one subset of the composite primary key, `assignment_id`, which does not comply with second normal form. Meanwhile, if both `professor_name` and `professor_email` are included in the 3rd table of sections, it would violate third normal form, as they are facts about each other instead of the key field, `section_id`.

2. **In Compliance with fourth normal form, keep the number of independent multi-valued facts about an entity under two.** If `section_id` is not part of the primary key in the 7th table of assignment info, then both `due_date` and `relevant_reading` become independent multi-valued facts that will violate the fourth normal form, as each assignment can have multiple due dates and relevant readings. This occurs specifically in two cases: 1) different sections with different due dates but the same relevant reading, 2) different sections with different relevant readings but with the same due date.
